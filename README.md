How to Access Project:

How to Watch the Fly Through: 
Open the timeline window. In the hierarchy, look under ===Cameras, then ===Empties for Camera Tracking, and select Empty1. Switch to the game window, then press play in the timeline window. Do not press the play game button at the top - for some reason it changes the placement of my cameras. If the view doesn't move or seems to be stuck staring into corners, go into the scene window, play from the timeline, then go back to the game view and it should have fixed itself. I truly do not know why.
