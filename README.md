# Project1
=======
## Project Organization
The Asset folder is sorted by types of Assets - please name assets clearly and uniquely. Models are just named what they are ("chair"), materials are what they are for followed by "_mat" ("chair_mat"), and textures are what they are for followed by "_tex" ("chair_tex"). In the Hierarchy window, everything is organized under empty objects - the empties are labeled with "===" and then what type of objects they contain. Label each model clearly.  

## How to Access Project: 
Download/Pull from GitHub, then open unity on your computer. Press the open button in the unity hub, then navigate to and select the Project1 file. Hit "Open" and the project should load in the unity editor. 

## How to Watch the Fly Through: 
Open the timeline window. In the hierarchy, look under ===Cameras, then ===Empties for Camera Tracking, and select Empty1. Switch to the game window, then press play in the timeline window. Do not press the play game button at the top - for some reason it changes the placement of my cameras. If the view doesn't move or seems to be stuck staring into corners, go into the scene window, play from the timeline, then go back to the game view and it should have fixed itself. I truly do not know why.
